## What is Galaxia?

Galaxia is a full-stack JavaScript framework for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Philosophy

Galaxia aims to be a simple-to-use framework with modern features,
while being conservative at the same time. The goal is to write code that is as close
as possible to the vanilla syntax.

## Key Features

#### JavaScript

- Vanilla JavaScript + [JSDoc](https://devhints.io/jsdoc) comments and optional ``.d.ts`` files for type safety. No ``.ts`` files.
- [ES6 modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) on the server and on the client.
- No transpilations, no build steps, no bundle files.
- No syntax separation between client and server.
- JSDoc comments used for validation of the HTTP parameters.
- Views are generated by Paintor.
- Import scripts from node_modules on the client.

#### CSS

- CSS, SASS or Stylus can be used.

#### Server

- A cluster process, controlling one or more workers.
- HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.
- Requests limiter (DDoS protection). Different settings can be used for different paths.
- Reverse proxy.
- Development and production mode.
- Automatic restart on file changes on development mode.
- Custom mime types, cache control and compression levels for the files, served to the client.
